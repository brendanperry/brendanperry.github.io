      <description>Hello! My name is Brendan Perry. I love God, have an incredible family of four, and enjoy watching the St. Louis Cardinals.
I am a software engineer who loves to build things. I have experience in mobile development with iOS, Android, and Xamarin, as well as back-end development in .NET.
My desire to learn new technology and tackle fun projects has driven my journey in software. I have always enjoyed playing video games and wanted to learn how to create my own.</description>

      <description>When I began my journey into software development, I only really wanted one thing. My goal was to create a mobile game.

      <description>Late last year I woke up to an email warning me that my bank account had been locked due to too many incorrect login attempts. I quickly found that my email and password had been compromised and that all of my online accounts were at risk to hackers. Luckily, my bank account passwords were different than my other personal accounts, but that did not give me much peace of mind. I was forced to change all my passwords for any account that I cared about and have been hesitant to use that email for anything since.</description>
