    <p>Murican’ Ninja is the first app that I made, and more importantly, the first software project that I ever tackled in general. During my freshman year of high school, I got together with my brother and cousin to come up with an app idea. I can’t say just how we came up with Murican’ Ninja, but this app has become a fun memory to hold onto over the years.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of development, we did not even know who was going to code or who was going to design graphics or even how to do either one of those things. Being math oriented, I decided to learn how to code. I watched a lot of online tutorials and used plenty of other online resources in order to create this app because, like I said before, it was the first code I had ever written.</p>
    <p>Looking back on it now, it’s almost comical how bad I was at programming, and I wish I had the skills that I now have to make that game. I have considered remaking it, but I’m not sure that it would be worth my time. Needless to say, I am thankful that I took the leap and made this app because it sparked my interest in software development as a whole.</p>
