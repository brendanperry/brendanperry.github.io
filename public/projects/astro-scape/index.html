Astro-Scape is the second game that I made using Unity3D. The game takes place in space, and the player’s role is to maneuver their ship through a meteor field. I made this game in 2015 alongside my brother and cousin who helped with ideas and design. Like all of my other apps made in Unity, I programmed it using C#.
As a beginner programmer, the greatest challenge that I faced while making this game was coming up with a system for ship customization.">
