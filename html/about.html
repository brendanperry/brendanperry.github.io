    <p>Hello,</p> 
    <p>My name is Brendan Perry. I am a student at Purdue Fort Wayne studying computer science. I currently work at Zimmer Biomet as an IT Intern.</p>
    <p>My freshman year of high school, I created my first app using Unity3D and C#. It was a small game, but it still very exciting for me. I loved creating games so much that decided to make seven more. I am currently working on number eight right now.</p>
    <p>I did not know how to code when I began making games, and I learned everything I could from the internet. It was not the most efficient way to learn how to code, but it did give me valuable experience that most people my age have not gotten. Most of the games that I created are nothing too impressive; however, it is easy to see the progression of my skills over time. As I learned more, I became more capable in problem solving, design, and overall speed. This allowed to make better games in smaller amounts of time.</p>
    <p>I love to learn new things and to build ideas into reality. My goal is to get a job as Software Developer after I graduate so I can continue to learn and build new things.</p>
